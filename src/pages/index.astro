    Hey, I'm Alan. I like meeting and working with the brightest minds.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm a senior studying CS@Caltech and runs the Quant Finance Club. Currently, I'm building interesting things at <a href="https://www.generalanalysis.com/">General Analysis</a>. In the past, I did some LLM/RL/optimization research with <a href="https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/">Hazy Research</a> and <a href="https://adamwierman.com/">Adam Wierman</a>'s Lab. I also did a bunch of programming and datasci contests. Check them out in <a href="/projects/">/projects</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of work, I play poker 🃏, badminton 🏸 and table tennis 🏓.
