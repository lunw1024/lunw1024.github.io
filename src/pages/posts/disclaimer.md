# Disclaimer

**Who am I?** You probably know at least a little bit about me if you are not a bot and got here out of interest. My current state of living is a mix of being a scholar, trader, and entrepreneur. I consider myself a bad writer, but I enjoy reading so much that I decided to do my own writing. I like things that have real impacts and make money. I enjoy conciseness and precision in communication, and try to be as unbiased as possible.

## What this blog isn’t

Nothing will be AI generated. There’ll be no quant prep content - there are plenty of good resources out [there](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Guide-Quantitative-Finance-Interviews/dp/1438236662). The blog won’t teach you how to make quick money. This blog will also not always be correct and insightful. I make mistakes often and is sometimes miscalibrated. I want every post to bring new insights, but I think reiterating on boring stuff can also be useful. I really enjoy creativity, but not if it sacrifices utility.

## What this blog is

Some of them will be my organized thoughts and opinions. Some may share some knowledge like projects and paper reviews. Some may be collections of hyperlinks to other interesting places. Everything will be relatively short and digestible, no fluff. I’ll also try to express my confidence levels on all unverified claims. It’s impossible to be unbiased, but I’ll never take any form of sponsorship. All content will be by me.

## Frequency

I can’t guarantee a fixed schedule - it’ll almost be entirely up to my discretion. Best guess is once every few weeks.
